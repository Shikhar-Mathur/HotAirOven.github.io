            A hot air oven is a laboratory instrument that uses dry heat to sterilize laboratory equipment and other materials.
            <br>
            <br>
Glassware (like petri dishes, flasks, pipettes, and test tubes), Powder (like starch, zinc oxide, and sulfadiazine), materials that contain oils, metal equipment (like scalpels, scissors, and blades) are sterilised using hot air oven.
<br>
            <br>
A hot air oven provides extremely high temperatures over several hours that can destroy microorganisms and bacterial spores,
The widely used temperature-time relationship in hot air ovens to destroy microorganisms are 170°C for 30 minutes, 160°C for 60 minutes, and 150°C for 150 minutes.

                <font color="Pink" style="font-weight: bold;"> Principle : </font>   The device works on the principle of dry heat sterilisation. The temperature of objects kept inside the insulated device increases as it moves from their surface to the core, layer by layer. Eventually, the entire object will reach the temperature required for sterilisation to occur.
                Dry heat is responsible for oxidizing particles. This in turn ruptures the cell components and the organism dies. To get rid of the most ambitious resistant spores, the temperature is held for roughly an hour.

                <font color="Pink" style="font-weight: bold;"> Working : </font> <ul>
                    <li>Wrap the articles with paper or enclose them in a container or metal canisters. Cotton wool must be inserted into the openings of test tubes, flasks, and pipettes. Metal canisters can be used to keep items such as pipettes and petri plates that need to be sterilised.</li>
                    <li>Set the items at a distance that will allow for uninterrupted airflow and open air circulation between them</li>
                    <li>Shut the door and turn on the hot air oven. </li>
                    <li>Once the thermometer indicates that the oven air has reached sterilizing temperature, heating is continued for the necessary amount of time (for example, 160°C for an hour).</li>
                    <li>To avoid breaking glassware, wait until the temperature drops to 40°C (about 2 hours) before removing sterilised goods.</li>
                </ul> 

                <font color="Pink" style="font-weight: bold;"> Precautions : </font> <ul>
                    <li> Inspect the oven before using it. The thermostat and all of the cords need to be operational</li>
                    <li> The oven's maximum temperature should not be exceeded</li>
                    <li> Ensure that the oven is clean of germs prior and after its usage</li>
                    <li> Do not use plastic material to avoid melting. Additionally, it may lead to exploding hazards.</li>
                </ul>
